Machine Learning on Medical Data
Hello everyone! Welcome to the Data Contest module of your PRML course.

Your task is to build supervised models to predict each of the six clinical descriptors using gene expression data of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The dataset is taken from two separate studies, and the model development should be done separately for each dataset. All six descriptors are binary and related to the disease status or treatment outcomes.


Dataset I consists of 130 samples and dataset II consists of 340 samples for training the classifiers. Dataset I includes 2 clinical descriptors and 4 descriptors in dataset II. As the dataset comes from a clinical setting, take the data characteristics into account while modeling.

Use the data in creative ways to build six classifiers for predicting each of the six clinical descriptors. You are free to choose any feature-selection/ensemble/non-deep learning models for classification, but make sure to give a brief description of them in the write-up.
